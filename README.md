dot-files
=========

These are just my dot files.  I was getting tired of setting these up all over
the place, so I'm using this as a semi-convenient location for them.

Github didn't let me pick it, but unless noted elsewhere, content here is
released under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net).  Seriously.
